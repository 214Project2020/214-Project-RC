CAMELCASE:
"camelCase is a naming convention in which the first letter 
of each word in a compound word is capitalized, except for the first word.
Software developers often use camelCase when writing source code.
camelCase is useful in programming since element names cannot contain spaces"

Single words ->       One.cpp One.h

Two words    ->       secondWord.cpp secondWord.h

Three words  ->       thisIsThree.cpp thisIsThree.h



EXCEPTIONS:

makefile  (write like that)
